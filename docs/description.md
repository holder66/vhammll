## Description

### What it is
- technology for pattern classification - making sense of what our senses tell us
- based on the physiology (mimics the functioning) of the central nervous system

### What it can do
- classify static patterns (eg images, microarray data, medical symptoms and test results, demographic data, survey results, etc.)
- classify serial (time-based) patterns (eg speech, movies, real-time sensor data, radar information, etc.) (under development)
- works with multiple classes
- handles missing data gracefully
- easily and accurately deals with situations where classes are not [linearly separable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_separability). This applies to 
many cases in physiology, biology,  and medicine (see [hormesis.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormesis))

### What makes it special
- one-trial learning - learns in a single pass
- robust - accommodates missing information, damage, or noise gracefully
- easy to convert into hardware - in silicon, possibly optical, molecular, or quantum computing
- lends itself to parallel computing
- has an exceptionally tiny footprint in terms of memory and computing resources needed

### What problems can it solve
#### data reduction
identifies and uses only those variables which are most likely to contribute to classification accuracy
#### image preprocessing
eliminates the need to correct for variations in size, skew, or rotation (under development)
#### noisy data
quickly identifies and removes from consideration variables which add noise

### Where it can be applied - potential use cases
- speech recognition
- emotion recognition (from facial expression, body language, speech prosody)
- prediction of weather, earthquakes, traffic patterns
- aircraft collision avoidance
- data mining (eg, for targeted advertising)
- diagnostic aid (medical, equipment maintenance, etc.)
- risk identification and management (loans, risk calculators for heart disease, etc.)
- real-time problem detection (bridges, computer networks, automobiles, railroads, aircraft, etc.)
- robotics
- neural prosthetic devices, to enhance our senses, processing capacity and speed, memory
