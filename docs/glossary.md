## Glossary of terms
**instances:** synonyms: cases; records; examples
- instances can be grouped into sets, eg training set, test set, validation set
- corresponds to a table row in a tabular data base

**dataset:** consists of a number of instances (cases, or examples)

**attributes:** synonyms: variables; fields; features
- corresponds to a column in a tabular data base. The attribute name is the column header
- one of the attribute will be the class attribute or class variable (also called the target variable, or class feature)
- attributes can be combined in various ways, to create new attributes

**attribute ranking:** the process of finding those attributes which provide the best classification performance

**classes:** the set of values that the class attribute can take

**parameters:** eg, the k in k-nearest-neighbors
- often, the work involved in applying machine learning to a problem is to find appropriate or optimal values for the parameters used by a given ML methodology

**Hamming distance:** (may also be called "overlap metric") the Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. In other words, it measures the minimum number of substitutions required to change one string into the other, or the minimum number of errors that could have transformed one string into the other. For binary strings a and b the Hamming distance is equal to the number of ones (population count) in a XOR b.

**bins:** the number of bins or slices to be applied for a given continuous attribute

**binning:** the process of converting a continuous attribute into a discrete attribute

**discrete:** (as applied to a attribute or variable): nominal or ordinal data

**continuous:** (as applied to a attribute or variable): real-valued
- ordinal data with a range greater than a certain parameter may also be treated as continous data
